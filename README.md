# data-engineering-project

## Overview
You are provided with a dataset folder containing three files:

* Train Predictors: A file with features labeled from red_0 to pred_1096.

* Train Targets: A file with target variables labeled from tar_0 to tar_190 .

* Test Predictors: A file with features labeled similarly (e.g., pred_0 to pred_n).

Your task is to design and implement a modular Python package that forms a complete data science pipeline.

## Project Requirements

### Data Preprocessing Module

* Input: Load the provided train and test datasets.

* Tasks:

  * Handle missing values and outliers.

  * Standardize or normalize feature values as appropriate.

  * Ensure data consistency and proper formatting for downstream tasks.

### Feature Engineering / Dimensionality Reduction Module

* Objective: Improve model performance by creating meaningful features or reducing dimensionality.

* Approaches:

    * Consider methods such as PCA, feature selection, or domain-specific transformations.

    * Document your methodology and rationale.

### Donor Split Modeling Module

* Purpose: Implement a donor split strategy to partition the data in a way that simulates realistic splits for training and validation.

* Tasks:

  * Create a function or class that efficiently partitions the dataset into training and testing subsets.

  * Ensure that the split strategy supports reproducibility.

### Fusion Component Using the Hotdeck Algorithm

* Objective: Develop a fusion mechanism that uses the Hotdeck algorithm for imputation or integration of data from multiple sources.

* Implementation:

    * Design the algorithm to impute missing values or merge donor data appropriately.

    * Provide clear documentation on how the algorithm integrates with the overall pipeline.

### Evaluation Module

* Goal: Assess the performance of your modeling approach.

* Tasks:

    * Compute appropriate evaluation matrices (e.g., confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression) based on your model’s predictions.

    * Ensure that these matrices are calculated on the test set derived from the donor split.

### Pipeline Integration

* Deliverable: Construct an end-to-end pipeline that seamlessly integrates all the above components.

* Requirements:

    * The pipeline should be modular, allowing each component to be developed, tested, and executed independently.

    * Provide a command-line interface or a clear notebook/script that demonstrates the complete flow—from data ingestion to model evaluation.

## Technical Expectations

* Code Quality: Your solution should be well-organized, adhere to PEP8 standards, and include comprehensive error handling.

* Documentation: Provide clear documentation for each module, explaining the design choices and how to use the package.

* Testing: Implement unit tests for critical functions to ensure robustness.

* Reproducibility: Ensure that your pipeline can be executed end-to-end with minimal configuration.

* Dependencies: Use standard Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) and clearly specify any additional dependencies.

## Submission Guidelines

* Package Structure: Deliver the solution as a Python package with separate modules for preprocessing, feature engineering/dimensionality reduction, donor split modeling, Hotdeck fusion, and evaluation.

* Execution Script: Include an executable script or notebook that demonstrates the complete pipeline.

* Documentation: Attach a README file detailing the package structure, installation steps, and instructions for running the pipeline.

* Testing: Provide test cases or a testing suite to validate the implementation.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Modularity & Code Quality: Clarity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

* Innovation: Effective and creative implementation of the Hotdeck fusion algorithm.

* Functionality: The pipeline should perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, donor splitting, modeling, and evaluation accurately.

* Documentation & Testing: Quality of documentation and robustness of tests provided.

* End-to-End Integration: Seamless integration of all components into a unified, reproducible pipeline.

* Project Planning: Realistic and detailed project timeline, with a clear breakdown of deliverables for the first week and overall project phases.

This assignment is designed to assess your ability to structure a complex data science project, implement key components, manage your time effectively, and deliver a production-ready pipeline. Please include your timeline with your submission, detailing what you expect to accomplish in the first week and outlining the overall project milestones. Good luck!
